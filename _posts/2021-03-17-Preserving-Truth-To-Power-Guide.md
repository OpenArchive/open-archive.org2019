<p>OpenArchive’s new guide to Preserving Truth to Power is specifically developed with and for citizen reporters and human rights defenders documenting injustice on their mobile phones. Download the guide here.</p>
  <p>In it, we share best practices for how to ethically and safely store sensitive mobile media, such as evidence of human rights violations, social movements, or everyday citizen reporting. We highlight long-term storage considerations when working with vulnerable sources, in order to help them more safely preserve, protect, and amplify what they’ve securely documented.</p>
